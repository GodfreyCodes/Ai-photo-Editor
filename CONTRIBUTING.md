# Thanks for contributing to the Clipboard Project! ðŸ‘‹

I am always accepting new contributions, whether it's code, documentation, or something else. 

## Guidelines for your valuable contributions

- Properly attribute your additions/modifications so that we can account for all the authors involved.

- Try to keep unrelated additions/modifications in separate PRs so that they're each easier to think about and take action upon.

- Make sure you format your code using our formatting scripts, and run the test suite.
